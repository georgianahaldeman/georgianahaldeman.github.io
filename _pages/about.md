Introduction to Cryptography (COSC 480)
- Cryptography is everywhere in our everyday life, from Internet security to cryptocurrency, and it has been around for more than 4000 years. In this course, we learn about the nuts and bolts of cryptography that we refer to as cryptographic primitives; we also study how these are used in constructions to achieve security services such as confidentiality, message authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. In parallel, we study the math behind some of these cryptographic primitives. Finally, we learn how to reason about and quantify the security of different constructions. The course work includes 6 programming assignments touching on different aspects of cryptography with a Capstone-like project at the end.

Intro to Computing II (COSC 102)
- A continuation of COSC 101 and the first course in the major. Develops advanced programming topics such as abstract data types and algorithms and their analyses. Abstract data structures may include lists, stacks, queues, maps, trees, and heaps; algorithms include search and sort procedures. The concepts of information hiding, data abstraction, and modular design are emphasized. Object-oriented programming is used throughout.
